Mobile Security & Privacy (MoSP) Siafu - Demo Simulation Cafe1
==============================================================
MoSP Siafu is an extension of the Siafu Open Source Context Simulator.
The extension has been developed for indoor simulation as sub-scenario
simulation of MoSP simulation using the Mobile Security & Privacy Simulator.
MoSP simulator and the Siafu MoSP addition have be created by staff and
students at the Distributed Computing & Security Group, 
Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, Germany in 2012-03.

The Cafe1 demo simulation simulates a cafe with 2 stories and 80 seats.
People that enter the cafe take a seat and stay for while. While staying
people can get infected by other people. The simulation itself does
not add any people and the simulation starts in paused mode. To run the
simulation with people and infection try the demo client:

 The demo client runs simulation for 60 simulated seconds/ticks,
 adds a healthy person, runs for 30 seconds, adds an infected person,
 and runs for 1200 seconds. The healthy gets infected within this time.
 
   usage: python python-demo-client/client.py 

Authors of Cafe1 demo simulation in alphabetical order are:
  Benjamin Henne, Paul Salomon, Christian Szongott
