From Eclipse
=============
In order to run Siafu from Eclipse, you may use the RunSiafu.launch
in the scripts folder. Notice that there's an -Xmx parameter to ensure
there's enough memory available to the JVM for siafu to run. 

Also, if you are going to test the same simulation over and over, you
may want to add the bin folder of your simulation to the command line
arguments, so you can skip the load screen. Something like:
--simulation=..\Simulation-Glasgow\bin

From Outside Eclipse
=====================
Simply use:
run.bat for Windows
run.sh for Linux
osxrun.sh for OSX
You can optionally add the path to your simulation (the packed jar, or the
bin folder if unpacked) to run a taht simulation automatically and skip the
load screen.
