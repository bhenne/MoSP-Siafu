How to start - try the demo
---------------------------

1) Build MoSP Siafu and Cafe1 simulation

   cd Siafu
   ant
   cd ..
   cd Simulation-Cafe1
   ant
   cd ..

2) Run Cafe1 MoSP simulation

   cd Siafu/release
   # for Linux 64bit arch
   bash runLinux64.sh --simulation=../../Simulation-Cafe1/release/Simulation-Cafe1.jar &
   # or use another run script; 
   # other systems than Linux do not need the "--simulation=", 
   # only use simulation jar path as parameter
   cd ../..

3) Start the demo client

   cd Simulation-Cafe1
   cd python-demo-client
   python client.py

   The demo client runs simulation for 60 simulated seconds/ticks,
   adds a healthy person, runs for 30 seconds, adds an infected person,
   and runs for 1200 seconds. The healthy gets infected within this time.

That's it.
